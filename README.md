I would like to give credit to a blog post that introduced me to this paper, when I was searching for Siamese Networks. The blog post  also includes code for this paper, despite having some differences regarding this repo (Adam optimizer is used, layerwise learning-rate option is not available). It is a great blog post go check it out:
